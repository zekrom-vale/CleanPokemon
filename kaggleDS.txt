All the following datasets has less data than the one I am creating.  You can see the data I have scraped and already processed at https://github.com/zekrom-vale/PokemonDB Do note, that I am using a custom package at https://github.com/zekrom-vale/zUtil.R


Alternative data sets

This data set has the information that I am interested in and a topic I like.  However, more limited than my own.

This data set is slightly better than the previous one, but still not to the degree that I have.

This data set has much more information than the previous ones about Pokemon, but it is limited to 7th generation

This data set is an alternative topic, instead of Pokemon, it is about crypto-currency.  This has 83.2k rows and 8 columns in long format.  It would be interesting trying to predict the future of each currency.  (I already know I would want to wrap by Currency).
